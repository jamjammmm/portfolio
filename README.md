a collection of some projects i've done at jones college prep in my junior year

Artist Generator Project: This project generates an artist based on the user's input. Each choice the user makes leads to a different pathway/artist. This program demonstrates how to use conditional statements to make an interactive and fun minigame.

Create Task Project: This program generates an inclusive list of vehicles based on user input. Users are asked to choose between different fuel types, different car sizes, and provide a price range. This program demonstrates usage of loops, lists, and boolean statements to sort lists while utilizing user input.

Mad Libs Generator Project: Like the artist generator, the program generates a paragraph based on user input. The user is prompted to enter various words to create a personalized narrative. This program demonstrates how to concactenate strings to tell a creative story.

Multiplication Quiz Project: Designed for little kids, this project helps students practice their multiplication through a program that makes user interaction simple. Users can customize the length of the quiz and receive their score upon quiz completion. This program demonstrates how to use imported libraries to create a program with randomly-generated numbers, avoiding repetition of the same questions.

Pokemon Project: An exciting and interactive game, this program is a recreation of the popular anime series, Pokemon. Users can choose from a menu of tasks each day to either work towards evolving their Pokemon, resting their Pokemon, or viewing their Pokemon's stats. This program demonstrates how to use conditional statements to convey changes in the program, such as changing your Pokemon's name when it evolves.

Rock Paper Scissors Project: Everyone has grown up playing Rock, Paper, Scissors, but not against a computer. The program features a statement made at the end of every round and a scoring system. Like the Multiplication Quiz Project, this program uses the random library to generate the computer's choice, allowing for an unpredictable game.

Slot Machine Project: Gambling is an addiction that many struggle with. With this program, the gambling addiction can be satisfied without any financial repercussions. This program features a digital slot machine that awards credits based on what you roll. This program demonstrates usage of the "random" library, a list, and boolean statements. 

Tetris Score Project: When a player finishes a game, they receive a score based on their performance. Using this program, users are able to determine whether they have received the newest high score or not. This project demonstrates how to use the "return" statement while utilizing loops, boolean statements, and a list.
